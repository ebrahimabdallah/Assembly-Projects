# Name of Project:
       Disease prediction (muscular dystrophy).
# About Code:
This code is for the muscular dystrophy test page, where it displays some questions related to the symptoms of the disease and, based on the answers yes or no, predicts the possibility of the disease.
# Technology used:
       I only used assembly language to write this code.
# Features:
 This page can predict the disease based on scientific and medical methods through a set of tangible symptoms. It is also possible to test different diseases by searching for the symptoms of this disease and presenting them for testing.
 # Setup:
  You can run the code and answer the symptoms of the disease by choosing the a or b code, and thus you can get the possibility of having the disease or not, and also get some encouraging and medical advice.
